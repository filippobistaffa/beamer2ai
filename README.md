Generate Video Presentation from Beamer Slides
===================

Dependencies
----------
Although not mandatory, running the project in a Python *virtual environment* is recommended:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Required dependencies can then be installed via `pip` with the following command:

    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

This project also requires a modern version of `ffmpeg` to render the video, which can be installed with:

    sudo apt install ffmpeg
